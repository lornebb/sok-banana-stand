## Clone, install, run

We suggest using Node Version Manager (NVM is suggested) for node versions. As of Jan 2023, this project uses Node 18.12.1

Once the repo is downloaded locally, make sure all packages are installed with `npm i`.

Then to run the dev server (which uses Vite) use: `npm run dev`.

## Design notes

### Colours

The main yellow used in the floating bananas and, most importantly, the colour matched logo is #FFCC33
